To create or edit a crontab file, enter the following into the command line:

crontab -e
If no crontab files are found in your system, the command will automatically create a new one. crontab -e allows you to add, edit, and delete cron jobs.

You’ll need a text editor like vi or nano to edit a crontab file. When entering crontab -e for the first time, you’ll be asked to choose which text editor you want to edit the file with.

To see a list of active scheduled tasks in your system, enter the following command:

crontab -l
If your system has multiple users, you can view their crontab file lists by entering the following command as a superuser:

crontab -u username -l
You can also easily edit other users’ scheduled jobs by typing the following crontab command:

sudo su crontab -u username -e
To give yourself root privileges, append sudo su to the beginning of the command. Some commands, including this one, can only be executed by root users.

Lastly, to delete all scheduled tasks in your crontab file and start fresh, type the following command:

crontab -r
Alternatively, the following command is the same as crontab -r, except it will prompt the user with a yes/no option before removing the crontab:

crontab -i
In addition to crontab, the root user can also add cron jobs to the etc/cron.d directory. It’s most suitable for running scripts for automatic installations and updates.

Keep in mind that the user adding cron jobs to this directory must have root access and conform to run-parts’ naming conventions.

Alternatively, a root user can move their scripts into the following directories to schedule their execution:

/etc/cron.hourly/ – Run all scripts once an hour
/etc/cron.daily/ – Run once a day.
/etc/cron.weekly/ – Run once a week.
/etc/cron.monthly/ – Run once a month.
